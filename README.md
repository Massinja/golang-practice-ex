Working on real-world projects is much more valuable than solely solving LeetCode problems. Nevertheless, I find some benefits of Leetcode, such as improving  my problem-solving skills, learning data structures and algorithms, and being able to think on the fly.
As a result, I'd like to challenge myself to solve at least one problem a day, every morning upon awakening. This practice will help my brain to warm up and get into programming mode. It will also make me happier :) I love solving logical problems and puzzles. Learning something new and accomplishing tasks is always rewarding, especially when it comes to algorithms. Quite often, I only see some naive approach using nested loops, but there is always a much more elegant and efficient way. Let's go! (Yes, I'll be mostly solving in Golang, as well as bash and SQL!)

Leetcode helps to track the progress. Today I am standing here:
