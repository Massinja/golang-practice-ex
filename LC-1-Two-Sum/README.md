### Problem  
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/  
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.  
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.  
You can return the answer in any order.  

### Solution  
Initially, I solved the problem using two for loops (O(n^2)), but later learned about a better way using hash map. What an exciting and clever way!
Time complexity is O(n).  
This time I wrote some tests instead of usual main function.
