### Problem  
A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward.   
Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers. Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

Example:

    Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
    Output: true
    Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.


#### some thoughts:  
When I first started programming, I watched a video featuring a YouTuber who had successfully gotten into Microsoft. In the video, she mentioned that during her interview coding challenge, she had to solve two problems. One of which was to determine whether a string was a palindrome or not.
Finally, I came across this challenge myself!
